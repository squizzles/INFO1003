					        <p>This Privacy Policy and any documents it references, inform you how we collect and
					            use the information (&ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo;) you provide when you register your details at the login stage. 
					            StepUp knows how much you care about the way your Personal Data is
					            used. We are committed to protecting the integrity and confidentiality of your information
					            and act in a careful, sensible manner in compliance with the Data Protection Act
					            1998. We appreciate the trust you place in us.</p>
					        <p>Personal Data refers to all information provided by you if you choose to register during the login stage.</p>
					        <p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. When we do we

		       			 <ul class="circle">
				            <li>When you visit our Web Site, we use cookies (<a href="#cookies">see below for more
				                information about cookies</a>) to collect web site usage information such as the

					            permission. We will only disclose your personal information, without your permission
					            or notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith believe that such action
					            is necessary to:</p>
		     		   <ul class="circle">
				            <li>Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us.</li>

					            you wish to receive.</p>

		      		  <h3 id="six">How secure is your Personal Data?</h3>
					        <p class = "lead">We recognise that people are increasingly concerned about the protection of Personal
					            Data from misuse and abuse, and about privacy in general. We constantly review and
					            enhance our technical, physical and managerial procedures in connection with the
					            collection, storage and disclosure of Personal Data in order to protect it from
					            unauthorised access, accidental loss and/or destruction.</p>
					        <p>We use industry standard 128 bit secure sockets layer (SSL) technology to encrypt
					            sensitive information.</p>
					        <p>It is important for you to remember to protect yourself against unauthorised access
					            by guarding your password. For example, if you use a shared PC, make sure you logout
					            or close your browser whenever you leave the PC.</p>
		      		  <h3 id="seven">Do we transfer Personal Data overseas?</h3>
					        <p class = "lead">The Internet is a global environment. Using the Internet to collect and process Personal
					            Data involves the transmission of data on an international basis. By browsing our

					            place in accordance with Australianlaw, and in particular for business purposes, such as
					            for quality control and training, and in order to prevent or detect crime.</p>
